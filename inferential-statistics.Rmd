## Probability Distributions

When performing basic inference, such as creating confidence intervals and calculating p-values, you can use basic inbuilt R operations which help speed up the process.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

#Normal Distribution
If you want to find the Z score associated with a probability, you can use qnorm.

```{r}
qnorm(0.99)
```

To calculate the p-value associated with a Z score, then you would use pnorm(), with lower.tail=FALSE if you wish to find the probability that a number is larger than a given number.

Find the probability (|Z|>2)
P Value
```{r}
pnorm(2.32, lower.tail = FALSE)
```
#T Distribution
Calculating t*df (t score)  for a two sided distribution at 95% confidence

```{r}
abs(qt(0.05/2, df=14,lower.tail=TRUE))
```
We use (pt(T-distribution,degrees of freedom,lower.tail=FALSE)*2 (*2 for a two-tailed test) to find the p-value for a t-distribution.

P Value
```{r}
pt(2.14, df=50, lower.tail= FALSE) * 2
```
A further example is provided below. 
Find the probability P(|t(df=10)|>2) where pt(x) x is t*df.
P Value
```{r}
pt(2, df=10, lower.tail= FALSE) * 2
```


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
